A machine learning project that predicts house prices using various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.  
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using a Python backend.

## 📌 Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Machine learning model training  
- Model saving using pickle  
- Backend API for predictions (Flask/FastAPI)  
- Ready for deployment on Render, Railway, or PythonAnywhere

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Select important features  
3. Train a regression model (Linear Regression / Random Forest / etc.)  
4. Save the trained model  
5. app.py loads the model and handles prediction requests  
6. User inputs are processed and passed to the ML model  
7. Model returns predicted house price
